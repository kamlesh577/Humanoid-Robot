# Humanoid-Robot
A humanoid robot is a robot with its body shape built to resemble the human body. The  functional purposes is to  interact with human tools and environments, for experimental purposes, such as the study of  locomotion, or for other purposes.

As we know that mobile robots has gain a lot of attention in the last few years.This increasing interest is motivated by the numerous useful task that a robot could perform for humans in our daily lives.To successfully perform such tasks the robot must guaranteethe safety of surrounding humans,thisraises a new challenge in term of researchwhere the concept of safe navigation attains a wider interpretation and aims to facilitatehuman-robot co-existence.
# Objective
1. To propse an integrated robot framework that allows navigation in a human populated environment.
2. To examine participants behavoir in human robot motion for different robot embodiments by scheming experiments.

InMoov is a humanoid robot, constructed out of 3D printable plastic body components, and controlled by Arduino microcontrollers. InMoov is a robot developed for artistic purposes by French sculptor Gael Langevin in September 2011 (The first blueprint files were published in January 2012 on Thingiverse) Its peculiarity is that it is reproducible with a simple 3D printer small format (12cm3) and its files are under Creative Commons license (CC-BY-NC). The project is a platform for development and robot learning. On this basis and through this concept there were developed different iterations.

## Methodology
3D printing is any of various processes in which material is joined or solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional object, with material being added together (such as liquid molecules or powder grains being fused together), typically layer by layer.3D printed objects can have a very complex shape or geometry and are always produced starting from a digital 3D model or a CAD file.

    • Filament Diameter: 1.75mm .
## Filaments
The raw material that keeps your printer printing is called filament. There’s an abundance of 3D printer filament choices available to you. Here, we’ll cover the common “daily driver” filaments like PLA and ABS.

## PLA
Poly(lactic acid) or poly lactic acid or polylactide (PLA) is a biodegradable and bioactive thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from renewable biomass, typically from fermented plant starch such as from corn, cassava, sugar cane or sugar beet pulp.  ![2052425b5f](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38343027/65830452-2cd76f00-e2cd-11e9-9af3-72d297d373c5.jpg)
