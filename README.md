# Humanoid-Robot
A humanoid robot is a robot with body shape built to resemble the human body. The  functional purposes is to  interact with human tools and environments, for experimental purposes, such as the study of  locomotion, or for other human related activities.

As we know that mobile robots has gain a lot of attention in the last few years.This increasing interest is motivated by the numerous useful task that a robot could perform for humans in our daily lives.To successfully perform such tasks the robot must guaranteethe safety of surrounding humans,thisraises a new challenge in term of researchwhere the concept of safe navigation attains a wider interpretation and aims to facilitatehuman-robot co-existence.
# Objective
1. To propse an integrated robot framework that allows navigation in a human populated environment.
2. To examine participants behavoir in human robot motion for different robot embodiments by scheming experiments.

InMoov is a humanoid robot, constructed out of 3D printable plastic body components, and controlled by Arduino microcontrollers. InMoov is a robot developed for artistic purposes by French sculptor Gael Langevin in September 2011 (The first blueprint files were published in January 2012 on Thingiverse) Its peculiarity is that it is reproducible with a simple 3D printer small format (12cm3) and its files are under Creative Commons license (CC-BY-NC). The project is a platform for development and robot learning. On this basis and through this concept there were developed different iterations.

## Methodology
3D printing is a process in which material is joined or solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional object, with material being added together (such as liquid molecules or powder grains being fused together), typically layer by layer.3D printed objects can have a very complex shape or geometry and are always produced starting from a digital 3D model or a CAD file.

Anet A8 3D Printer  DIY Printer is a useful yet affordable 3D printer for beginners and enthusiasts alike with its capable extruder and hotbed.  It is made by using Acrylic or Aluminium Composite (Aluminium surface with plastic structure) 

• XY Axis Accuracy: 0.012mm Z-Axis Accuracy: 0.004mm , 
    
•  Max Print Size: 220x220x240mm , 
    
• Heating Plate Material: Aluminium 
    
• Printable Materials: PLA, ABS, TPU, Wood Poly, PVA, PP, Nylon, Luminescent 
    
• Filament Diameter: 1.75mm .
## Filaments
The raw material that keeps your printer printing is called filament. There’s an abundance of 3D printer filament choices available to you. Here, we’ll cover the common “daily driver” filaments like PLA and ABS.

## PLA
Poly(lactic acid) or poly lactic acid or polylactide (PLA) is a biodegradable and bioactive thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from renewable biomass, typically from fermented plant starch such as from corn, cassava, sugar cane or sugar beet pulp.

# Requirement and Specifications 
The humanoid robot is made by using 3D printing so it requires 3D printer to print files.
• 3D Printer
    
• Stepper motor
    
• Arduino
    
•  motor controllers
    
• Raspberry pi , Pi-camera
    
• PLA
# Specifications:
    • It has been designed as a torque-controlled robot with 12 DOF, with motors directly connected to the joint with a low gear ratio. 'This configuration allows for compliant motion and good back-variability without using joint torque sensors.
    
    • All in all, the lower body weighs just '38.795kg, slightly under the estimated 40kg used in the motor selection and simulation. 
    
    • It will be able to perform basic human tasks like walking or moving.
    
    • Able to recognize object to walk without touching them.
    
# Making of project:
The robot was made using 3D printer and uses STL parts for 3D printing.The parts can be found at:
http://inmoov.fr/inmoov-stl-parts-viewer/
and some parts needs to be upgraded according to your requirement.
