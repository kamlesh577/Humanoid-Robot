# Humanoid-Robot
A humanoid robot is a robot with its body shape built to resemble the human body. The  functional purposes is to  interact with human tools and environments, for experimental purposes, such as the study of  locomotion, or for other purposes.

As we know that mobile robots has gain a lot of attention in the last few years.This increasing interest is motivated by the numerous useful task that a robot could perform for humans in our daily lives.To successfully perform such tasks the robot must guaranteethe safety of surrounding humans,thisraises a new challenge in term of researchwhere the concept of safe navigation attains a wider interpretation and aims to facilitatehuman-robot co-existence.
# Objective
1. To propse an integrated robot framework that allows navigation in a human populated environment.
2. To examine participants behavoir in human robot motion for different robot embodiments by scheming experiments.

InMoov is a humanoid robot, constructed out of 3D printable plastic body components, and controlled by Arduino microcontrollers. InMoov is a robot developed for artistic purposes by French sculptor Gael Langevin in September 2011 (The first blueprint files were published in January 2012 on Thingiverse) Its peculiarity is that it is reproducible with a simple 3D printer small format (12cm3) and its files are under Creative Commons license (CC-BY-NC). The project is a platform for development and robot learning. On this basis and through this concept there were developed different iterations.
